# stone_paper_scissor_lizard_spok

A game created by Sam Kass , a extended version of stone paper scissor. When you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well,so this is a slight variation that reduces that probability. 


As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

You can now find the updated game python file in-progress in a separate file. It will be merged once complete.
HAPPY TBBT TIME :)
